### A Geo-Agent–Driven U-Net Architecture for High-Fidelity Seismic Reconstruction

---

## Abstract

This repository presents a modular seismic signal enhancement framework built upon a guided U-Net topology augmented with an adaptive geo-agent evaluation mechanism. The system is designed to restore degraded seismic sections while preserving amplitude fidelity, phase continuity, and spectral coherence across spatial and temporal domains.  

The framework emphasizes physically consistent signal reconstruction rather than naive noise suppression, enabling stable enhancement across structurally complex subsurface regimes.

## 1. Motivation and Problem Formulation

Seismic signal degradation arises from a combination of acquisition limitations, environmental interference, and propagation effects. Traditional filtering techniques often impose linear assumptions that fail to preserve subtle geological signatures such as:

- Stratigraphic terminations  
- Thin-bed interference patterns  
- Diffraction energy  
- Weak-amplitude reflectors  

The objective of this framework is to **learn a nonlinear inverse mapping** that reconstructs a latent clean seismic representation while enforcing domain-specific constraints derived from geophysical signal theory.

---

## 2. Conceptual Overview

The framework decomposes seismic enhancement into three interacting subsystems:

1. **Primary Reconstruction Network**  
2. **Geo-Agent Signal Evaluator**  
3. **Multi-Domain Consistency Enforcement**

Rather than treating enhancement as a purely pixel-wise regression problem, the system introduces an adaptive evaluation agent that continuously estimates signal realism within the seismic domain.

## 3. U-Net Theoretical Foundation

### 3.1 Encoder–Decoder Duality

The U-Net architecture operates by jointly optimizing:

- **Downsampling paths** to extract hierarchical semantic representations
- **Upsampling paths** to restore spatial resolution while retaining contextual coherence

Let \( X \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W} \) represent a degraded seismic section.  
The encoder computes a sequence of feature embeddings:

\[
E_i = f_i(E_{i-1}), \quad i \in [1, N]
\]

where each \( f_i \) corresponds to a convolutional operator followed by normalization and nonlinear activation.

---

### 3.2 Skip-Guided Information Transport

Unlike standard encoder-decoder pipelines, the architecture preserves intermediate representations via skip connections:

\[
D_i = g_i([E_i, \uparrow D_{i+1}])
\]

This mechanism ensures:

- Phase alignment preservation  
- Local amplitude continuity  
- Structural edge retention  

The skip pathways act as **geological memory conduits**, allowing fine-scale reflectivity patterns to bypass aggressive compression stages.

---

### 3.3 Guided Reconstruction Principle

The reconstruction network is not optimized in isolation. Its outputs are continuously assessed by an auxiliary geo-agent that estimates signal plausibility rather than numerical similarity alone.

---

## 4. Geo-Agent Signal Evaluation

### 4.1 Rationale

Numerical loss functions such as L1 or L2 norms fail to capture higher-order seismic characteristics such as:

- Frequency balance
- Coherency of dipping events
- Amplitude-versus-offset consistency

To address this, a **geo-agent evaluator** is introduced.

---

### 4.2 Geo-Agent Architecture

The geo-agent is a compact convolutional network trained to assign scalar consistency scores to seismic sections. It learns to distinguish physically coherent seismic responses from implausible reconstructions.

Given a section \( S \), the agent computes:

\[
\mathcal{E}(S) \in \mathbb{R}
\]

representing its alignment with learned seismic priors.

---

### 4.3 Adversarial-Free Competitive Learning

The evaluator and reconstruction network form a **competitive optimization loop** without explicit adversarial labeling. The enhancer attempts to maximize evaluator scores while minimizing reconstruction losses, leading to:

- Reduced hallucinated amplitudes  
- Stable enhancement across unseen geological regimes  

---

## 5. Multi-Domain Loss Modeling

### 5.1 Time-Domain Consistency

Primary reconstruction error is enforced via robust L1 distance:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{time} = \mathbb{E}[|S_{enhanced} - S_{clean}|]
\]

This favors amplitude preservation over aggressive smoothing.

---

### 5.2 Spectral Consistency Constraint

To prevent frequency leakage and spectral distortion, the framework enforces magnitude consistency in the Fourier domain:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{freq} = \mathbb{E}[|\ |\mathcal{F}(S_{enhanced})| - |\mathcal{F}(S_{clean})|\ |]
\]

This constraint stabilizes bandwidth and suppresses artificial frequency amplification.

---

### 5.3 Combined Objective

The final optimization objective is defined as:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{time} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{freq} - \alpha \mathcal{E}(S_{enhanced})
\]

where \( \lambda \) and \( \alpha \) control spectral rigidity and geo-agent influence respectively.

## 6. Training Dynamics

### 6.1 Alternating Optimization

The system employs alternating optimization:

- Geo-agent updates stabilize evaluation boundaries
- Reconstruction network updates maximize realism under constraints

This dynamic prevents mode collapse and excessive amplitude inflation.

---

### 6.2 Amplitude Stability Considerations

Special care is taken to ensure:

- No implicit normalization leakage between clean and degraded samples
- Independent statistical treatment of each domain
- Preservation of relative amplitude contrasts

---

## 7. Inference Behavior

During inference, the geo-agent is decoupled, and only the trained reconstruction network is used. This ensures:

- Deterministic enhancement
- Low-latency deployment
- Stable amplitude scaling

---

## 8. Design Philosophy

This framework adheres to the following principles:

- **Physics-aware learning**
- **No blind denoising**
- **Amplitude first, aesthetics second**
- **Geology over metrics**

The architecture is intentionally over-parameterized to allow geological generalization rather than dataset memorization.

---

## 9. Intended Use Cases

- Pre-stack seismic conditioning  
- Post-stack signal enhancement  
- Structural imaging improvement  
- Weak reflector recovery  

---

## 10. Disclaimer

This framework is designed for research and controlled industrial environments. Results must be validated against geological knowledge and acquisition parameters prior to interpretation.

---

## 11. Future Extensions

- Multi-offset conditioning
- Anisotropic attention blocks
- Depth-aware geo-agents
- Physics-guided regularization terms
